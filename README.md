# Django Learning Project

This is my first Django project, built as a learning exercise to understand the basics of the Django framework. The project includes a simple employee listing and detail view system, demonstrating core features of Django such as URL routing, views, models, templates, and the ORM.

---

## ðŸ“š Purpose

The main goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with:

- Django project/app structure
- Defining and registering URL routes
- Creating views to render templates
- Using Djangoâ€™s ORM to interact with a database
- Building and extending HTML templates
- Managing static and media files

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- List of employees with basic information
- Employee detail page with more information
- Static homepage with a welcome message
- Base template extended by all pages
- Navigation between pages using URL routing
